# Random-works
Random tasks on youtube but i put my own spin on them to write the codes.
This was meant to be a 30day coding project from a website link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de4W0EHMuUs&list=PLRv_Gd5w9e7m7wokXmB9fGtGYw100UKc0.
Some codes were followed and copied verbatim but some i decided to write differently from the coder
I am particularly proud of the photo gallery app code as the codes were my original idea
